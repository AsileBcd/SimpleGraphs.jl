SimpleGraphs
============

This is a Julia module that provides a `SimpleGraph` type for working with 
*simple graphs*: graphs without loops, multiple edges, or directed edges.

To get started, get the package like this:
```julia
julia> Pkg.clone("https://github.com/scheinerman/SimpleGraphs.jl.git")
```
Much more to follow (including documentation).
This is placeholder README for now.
