This is a Julia module that provides a `SimpleGraph` type for working with 
*simple graphs*: graphs without loops, multiple edges, or directed edges.

To get started, get the package like this:
```julia
julia> Pkg.clone("https://github.com/scheinerman/SimpleGraphs.jl.git")
```
The in any Julia sesssion, just give the command
`using SimpleGraphs`.

The documentation is in the `doc` folder in a file named `SimpleGraph.pdf`.

This is very much a work in process with a lot of more features that
can/should be added. If you're interested in contributing, please
contact me. I'm especially interested in JHU undergraduates getting involved.
